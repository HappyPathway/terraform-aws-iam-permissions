# Terraform AWS IAM Permissions Module

Create a Terraform module for managing IAM permissions required by CodeBuild jobs to provision infrastructure.

## Requirements

1. Create a flexible Terraform module for generating IAM roles and policies for CodeBuild jobs.
2. Support dynamic permission sets based on the infrastructure being provisioned.
3. Implement a system for creating least-privilege IAM policies for various Terraform modules.
4. Support cross-account access when necessary.
5. Provide integration with the CodeBuild pipeline module.

## Module Structure

1. Follow Terraform module best practices for structure and organization.
2. Create separate resource files for logical groupings.
3. Provide comprehensive variable definitions with proper descriptions and defaults.
4. Include useful outputs for integration with the CodeBuild module.
5. Create examples directory with common usage patterns.

## Features

1. Template-based IAM policy generation for common Terraform providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
2. Support for custom policy statements for specialized resources.
3. Role assumption configuration for cross-account access.
4. Implementation of IAM permission boundaries.
5. Support for resource tagging-based permissions.
6. Session duration configuration.
7. Support for Service Control Policies integration.
8. Permission auditing capabilities.

## Permission Patterns

1. Implement common permission sets for:
   - EC2 and networking resources
   - S3 buckets and objects
   - DynamoDB tables
   - Lambda functions
   - RDS databases
   - IAM resources (self-management)
   - Other common AWS services
2. Provide composable permission modules for different resource types.
3. Create helper functions for generating least-privilege policies.

## Security Considerations

1. Implement best practices for IAM role trust relationships.
2. Use principle of least privilege for all generated policies.
3. Support for temporary credentials and session policies.
4. Implement conditional statements for enhanced security.
5. Support MFA enforcement where applicable.

## Documentation

1. Create comprehensive README with usage examples.
2. Document all variables and outputs clearly.
3. Include policy examples for common scenarios.
4. Provide guidance on security best practices and permission scoping.
5. Document how to extend the module for custom permission sets.
